        <div class="css-container">
            <p>While in year 7, I was introduced to the MicroBee computer system through my high school computing class. At about the same time my father bought home a Commodore 64 computer, this was generally considered a bad move on his part, as I discovered a thing called video games!</p>
            <p>Our school begun offering classes in using the MicroBee and Amiga computers in the school library, on using basic word programs and publishing software, which somehow, I found interesting. I was amazed at what could be achieved by a simple word processor, how you could incorporate text and images on a computer.</p>
            <p>When I discovered the game called Ultima IV, my best friend and I learnt the meaning of “pulling an all-nighter” trying to beat such an awesome game. I still remember the shock of seeing that sunrise while still trying to find the solution to an in-game puzzle and being nowhere near finished wondering where time had gone. This is where my interest in IT and all things computer related began, on the sunrise of that day, of my first all-nighter computer game session, with my best friend, James beside me, facilitated by my father bringing home our families first computer.</p>
            <p>My experience with IT up to today, has essentially been as a user. I have a basic understanding, and knowledge of software packages like CAD, Microsoft Office suite of products, Adobe Premier video editing software, and of course, gaming. Obviously, MS Flight Simulator, MMRPG and virtual reality (VR) with my Oculus Rift setup.</p>
            <p>During my employment in the aviation industry, I have watched the industry move from paper-based record keeping systems to computer-based record keeping, along with technical drawing and design software development. This has mainly been because paper-based data is difficult to track and maintain, while it quite easy to maintain and track important data in a digital format and requires far less physical space to retain the same amount of data. Digitisation has made its way onto the flight decks and cabins of passenger airliners, and over the past decade has started to emerge in light aircraft. With improvements in augmented reality (AR) and VR systems, I can see many areas where this and other computer technology can enhance aviation safety. AR/VR can improve situational awareness for flight crews by providing features such as airspace overlays, other aircraft positions, or even air traffic control flight path direction displayed directly to crew as they look outside the windows.</p>
            <p>My decision to choose RMIT to study for my Bachelor in ITC, was based on a few factors:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>the requirement to be entirely conducted online, as I am working full time, on campus classes would be very difficult, so this narrowed the choices to institutions that delivered courses online.</li>
                <li>I was aware of the reputation of RMIT for quality courses and graduates particularly in technology related fields, and engineering, so this became the obvious choice when I discovered that RMIT were offering the bachelor in IT 100% online.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>While studying at RMIT, Bachelor of ITC, I hope to gain a broad but deep enough understanding of the various disciplines within the IT industry, so that I may become employable in an area of my choosing. I am interested in AI and machine learning, I drive a car that is heavily reliant on AI for its driver aids, but math has never been my strong point. I am also interested in learning a lot more about AR and VR so that I can apply what I learn and find opportunities to apply AR technologies in the aviation and flight safety industry.</p>
