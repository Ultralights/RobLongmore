        <p>Born in Sydney Australia in 1974 and grew up in Cronulla and “The Shire”, which meant lot of time in the surf 
            and immersed in Australian beach culture. Strangely enough, I developed a love of all things snow related, especially snowboarding, as skiing is nothing like surfing.</p>
        <p>My teen years were spent enrolled at Gymea Technology High School where I completed year 12. And gained my HSC. It was this time I witnessed the birth of the internet 
            and was fortunate enough to get exposure to computing and bulletin boards that might have been called the internet at that time. It was this that grew my interest in 
            IT and computer related activities, although this was succeeded by my love of Aviation when I learnt to fly.</p>
        <p>My friends and myself, would regularly gather in the school library to use the new MicroBee and the Amiga computer systems the school had. We would log into local
             bulletin boards with 9600 baud modems, and trade games and other software, until someone picked up a phone and killed the connection.
              If my friends and I were not on a computer, we would be playing Dungeons and Dragons campaign or just nerding out over the latest tech news or gadgets.</p>
        <p>My love for all things aviation came when I was in my early high school years, my parents took the family to Hong Kong.
             I was fortunate enough to spend the landing part of the flight sitting in the cockpit as we arrived in Hong Kong. At 16 years of age, 
             I began learning to fly, and quickly attained my private pilot licence, meaning I could fly planes alone before I could drive alone.
              This was an interesting situation, as I would need to get my parents to drive me to the airport so I could take a light aircraft and fly away by myself. </p>
        <p>As I was completing my HSC studies and exams, I had to make a choice, follow my friends working with computers, 
            or follow my love of aviation. As I had my private pilot’s licence, and flying is expensive, 
            I followed the aviation path, entering an apprenticeship as a trainee aviation structural engineer with Qantas.</p>
        <p>Working as an engineer was interesting, and allowed me to continue with hobbies, mainly flying, 
            snow trips, camping, surfing, keeping up with friends, and new things in tech. My career
            has allowed me to work on some rather cool and interesting aircraft, From the Concorde
            to Military fast jets, and military helicopters.</p>
        <p>In my mid 20’s, I also went on to gain my flight instructors rating and work part time as a flying instructor. As flying was a passionate hobby, I found that working as an instructor dampened that enthusiasm and took the fun out it. Coupled with students occasionally trying to kill me, I gave up the flight instruction to try to bring that passion back, and the love of being able to fly when and where I wanted.</p>
        <p>It was around this time that my employer, funded my desire to continue my education, and I graduated the University of New South Wales, (UNSW) with a Graduate Certificate in Aviation Management, passing with Distinction grades. </p>
        <p>Now, in my forties, I have lost the passion for engineering in aviation, combined with climbing in and out of awkward and dangerous places inside aircraft, there is only so many times you can inspect inside a toilet holding tank, or climb into a fuel tank, and the body not getting any younger, I have decided now is an opportune time for a career change. Since I enjoyed playing with computers as a teenager, all my friends and spouse work in IT, along with my continued interest in all things new in tech, I have decided to take on a career in information technology.</p>
