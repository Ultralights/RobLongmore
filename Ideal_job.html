			<h1><strong>Role Description</strong></h1>
			<p>Essentially the role is to discover new product lines through identifying new technologies, collaborating with internal and external stakeholders, along with identifying other businesses, new ways to improve current aviation-based products, and develop new products to keep the company innovative, and differentiate the company from its competitors. Additionally, this role will help the company enhance market growth and keep the company at the forefront of new aviation technology, this will include monitoring competitor’s products, and using their developments to find ways to improve the company’s products and help maintain a lead of the competition.</p>
			<p>You are also required to manage business negotiations with technology partners and suppliers, and management of marketing and other advertising related functions, such as social media campaigns and finding new business and product opportunities</p>
			<p>I find this role attractive to me as it appeals to my desire to constantly want to see new technologies implemented in the Aviation industry, and to see constant change, coupled with my will to find solutions. My training and experience in aircraft engineering and maintenance, with hard deadline customers and contractual pressures, mean I must find ways to fix issues. In many cases, those issues are unique to each situation. Requiring drawing on experiences from different trades and skillsets, civilian staff and military to come up with safe solutions. I also understand the power and influence that can be gained from social media, marketing and searching for feedback from your customers; and how these can help in improving your product or content.</p>
			
			<h2><strong>Qualifications and Experience </strong></h2>
			<p>Base qualifications for this position are a degree, but that can be a degree in quite a few disciplines, ranging from computer sciences, IT, industrial and engineering to business and marketing fields.</p>
			<p>Fortunately, I already possess over 30 years’ experience in the Aviation maintenance engineering, and flight operations fields, and hold a degree in Aviation Management, making me suitable for this role. With regards to aviation product development, I have gained over 1000 hours flight experience as pilot in command. Being a pilot, I already have high levels of experience using quite a few Garmin related products, and know what features would be desirable to pilots, and those features and products which are less used buy pilots and flight crew.</p>
			<p>The position requires the usual skills for a management position, dealing with various stakeholders requiring strong communications skills, both written and verbal, negotiating experience, and office computer skills.</p>
			<p>My degree in Aviation Management from UNSW, and 17 years working within a military environment, as a civilian, means I am well versed in managing the requirements and the merging of 2 vastly different workforces, to achieve a desired outcome for the customer. I am comfortable communicating with staff and people from all levels of an organisation, be it civilian or military.</p>
			<p>At this point I do not posses a degree in a computer related field and feel this degree I am currently studying from RMIT, will add to my employability in this role. Through developing an understanding of the broad area that is IT, this will give me the skills the role. These new skills will allow me to identify new technologies in IT and communications that will aid my ability to determine the suitability of new technology to create new and improve existing products. This role would see the merging of my two lifelong interests, I will bring a lifelong held passion and excitement to the role, and a desire to continually explore new developments from IT and technology brought together in an aviation environment</p>
			<p>My current studies in IT, via this course with RMIT, and further studies into the future, leaning towards AR, VR and possibly machine learning, with the aim of achieving the highest academic scores possible, means I will gain the formal qualifications and complete the merging of my interests into an exciting new career developing cool new products and technology and bringing them into new markets.</p>
