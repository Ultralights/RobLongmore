            <h2><strong>Overview</strong></h2>
                <p>Aviation navigation relies on very complicated maps and charts (Civil Aviation Safety Authority 2021). These charts are like maps, showing landmarks, rivers, mountains and waterways. Unlike conventional maps, aviation maps, or charts, also map the 3rd dimension, including airspace use types, and specific flight paths and altitudes. Pilots are required to interpret theses 2 dimensional charts, into a 3D airspace and fly the aircraft accordingly, all the while looking for other aircraft and following Air traffic control instruction. With our new AR Navigator, pilots will now see all the critical data, in 3D, overlayed over the real world, giving unparalleled situational awareness.</p>

            <h2><strong>Motivation</strong></h2>
                <p>Failure of situational awareness, or human error, is a contributor in over 70% of aircraft accidents (Bureau of Air Safety Investigation 1996). Airspace charts are constantly amended, flight crews need to interpret the 2D information into 3D environment, sometimes while under extreme workload. A system is required that can reduce pilot workload, and human error significantly, by displaying the critical data directly over the pilots view of the outside world, giving an immediate situational awareness picture, future path projection and air traffic control instruction. Not only saving lives but allowing more efficient use of airspace and reducing environmental impact.</p>

            <h2><strong>Description</strong></h2>
                <p>The AR Navigation system uses 3 main components, the AR display system, utilising exiting hardware, such as Microsoft HoloLens or Nreal glasses, a tracking system to track the users head movements, and the software component. Aircraft cockpits are static, and donâ€™t change, so the placing of positional markers within the cockpit will allow cameras on the headset to accurately provide positional data to the system. These positional trackers can be small, and easily installed in any aircraft, or with software, scanning the fixed cockpit structure, determine the head position and view angles.</p>
                <p>The wearable headset containing a small camera and IR transmitter, and eye movement tracking can determine its position in 3D space relative to the cockpit environment, via the eye tracking from within the headset, can provide distance data to determine where the wearer is looking, distinguishing between looking outside the aircraft or inside the cockpit.</p>
                <p>Approved Aviation navigational charts are currently already used in a digital format, known as electronic flight bags (Civil Aviation Safety Authority 2022) with data from the aircrafts GPS, or portable receivers via Bluetooth, can plot your aircraft position on these charts. This is usually displayed on a tablet or panel mounted screen. Software will have to be written to add the altitude data to airspace and aircraft positions on the 2D charts, and recreate the navigational, and other aircraft position data, to be displayed in the AR headset, and overlayed onto the outside world.</p>
                <p>Most modern aircraft autopilot systems can follow a set track, or compass heading, and maintain an altitude input by the pilot, usually taken from a flight plan, or air traffic control instruction. This data can be entered manually, or taken from the aircrafts pre-programmed GPS navigation system, this data can then be displayed in the headset, providing accurate track for the pilot to follow if flying manually.</p>
                <p>Other aircraft positional data is supplied by a system called Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) (Airservices Australia) which transmits, along with GPS position, the aircraft speed, altitude and heading. This data can be added into the AR display to show crews wearing the AR Navigator headset, the precise location of other aircraft in proximity, along with the projected heading of other aircraft. Using autopilot track data, the software can also determine a possible collision risk and alert the crew if necessary.</p>
                <p>For improved adoption of this technology across all sectors of aviation, cost is a key consideration. Our system will use existing technologies, such as of the shelf AR headsets, combined with existing digital flight bag software, and with our software development, to display that data, in 3D over the outside view of the world. Our equipment requirements are the AR headset, available commercially already, the tablet software to transmit the data to the headset, with option for aircraft derived GPS data if the tablet itself does not have a GPS receiver, and ADS-B inputs. Future expansion is possible removing the need for an instrument panel entirely.</p>

            <h2><strong>Tool and Technology</strong></h2>
                <p>The headset will need to be light weight, and comfortable to wear over long periods of time, headsets like the Nreal line of glasses would be suitable (Nreal 2022). Tablets used for electronic flight bag software supporting navigational charts and navigation positional data are available from a variety of manufacturers (Hiltunen et al. 2015) specifically for aviation use, and with WIFI or Bluetooth capability, inputs from portable ADS-B and GPS receivers can by utilised (Garmin 2022). The system will need redundancy in wireless technology and reliable data from external sources, and improvements in screen miniaturisation and readability</p>

            <h2><strong>Skills Required</strong></h2>
                <p>The backbone of the system is the software that is required to relay the data from the electronic flight bag software to the headset. This will require software programming and interface design, to display aviation navigation charts, position and ADS-B data for precise location of other aircraft within an airspace area. It must be capable of taking head, and eye tracking data from the headset, and convert this data to a 3D graphical display overlayed in the correct position in space to represent the data with high degree of fidelity in the field of view in the real world.</p>

            <h2><strong>Outcome</strong></h2>
                <p>The aim of this project is to increase aviation safety in all levels of aviation, by reducing pilot workload, removing the need of the crew to interpret 2D airspace data, other aircraft positions, and future flight path projection, and displaying this data over the real world outside the cockpit window. This will increase pilot and flight crew situational awareness and only show data that is relevant to safe and accurate flight. With increased flight accuracy, comes a secondary benefit of reducing the flights environmental impact, resulting in lower fuel burns, with improved flight track optimisation, and more efficient use of airspace.</p>
