            <h2><strong>16Personalities</strong></h2>
                <p>According to the personality test done via 16Personalities (NERIS Analytics Limited 2022) I would have to agree, their insights are quite accurate, showing I am introverted and observant.</p>
                <p>I am most productive in the evening, and loved working night shift, 3pm to 11pm. I’m a night owl that’s for sure.</p>
                <p>I would not agree with picking music related hobbies, yes, I love music, loud, and new, always looking for new music to listen to, but I wouldn’t call my hobbies, which are flying, social media, and computers, to be particularly relate to music.</p>
                <p>I do feel better helping others and support other people to help them achieve their aims, and don’t seek to be powerful. I would agree that I am very democratic, everyone has an equal right to their views, beliefs and actions, if it doesn’t impact negatively on others. And Tuesdays, I hate Tuesdays, Mondays I’m ok with</p>

                <p><strong><em>76% Introverted</em></strong>
                Agree, I prefer spending time alone, or with close friends and family than being in public. Previous personality testing results classified me as a “social introvert” which I would agree with, as much as I prefer time alone or working by myself, I am comfortable in public and busy social scenes, though it’s not my preferred situation. I am, however, capable of being social and not standing on the side-lines.</p>

                <p><strong><em>54% Observant</em></strong>
                Yes, I am one to try my best to look at all possible outcomes in a situation and rely on data and evidence to form an opinion. I try to find solutions that will help the most people or have the most beneficial outcome. Unfortunately, taking time to think about a situation, and seek more data can be seen as a bad thing, and many take it as not being able to think quickly, or acting to slowly. Though I can make decisions quickly based on limited information if needed, though I am not comfortable doing it</p>

                <p><strong><em>56% Feeling</em></strong>
                Or Emotional, more empathetic, my decisions are usually based on how I make others feel, and I can easily empathise with others and their emotional states, and care deeply for my close friends and family, even when going months or years without contact. I always wonder how they are doing and will happily go out of my way to them and help others.</p>

                <p><strong><em>69% Prospecting</em></strong>
                Prospecting As my manager once told me, I can be trusted to get the job done, but on my terms, and in my timeframe, but it will get done by the deadline. Meaning I will find distractions and will do other tasks or indulge in distractions, while still working towards the main goal. I cannot set a personal deadline or schedule to work to but will get there when I need to</p>

                <p><strong><em>71% Assertive</em></strong>
                Agree, I am very confident in myself as a person, and have a very stable temper, I try my best to remain calm in most situations. However, I will get frustrated at times with myself if I fail to understand something. I am good at not getting worried to much, unless a situation is life threatening, or have significant financial consequences, I can distil down to what is important and put aside smaller more trivial issues.</p>

                <p>Learning Style test (Agency 2022).</p>


                <p><strong><em>Auditory 20%</em></strong></p>
                <p><strong><em>Visual 70%</em></strong></p>
                <p><strong><em>Tactile 10%</em></strong></p>
                <p>Studies have shown 33% of the population are visual learners 26% audio, 12% are audio/visual learners (Buşan 2014), as am I. I prefer diagrams and drawing, and video, to understand how stuff works or understand the concept, as they say, a picture tells 1000 words, so how many words does a video tell? I prefer video format as a way of learning. I found in my experience as a flying instructor, that students prefer to be shown how things work, rather than reading from a book in a briefing.</p>

            <h2><strong>Work style test</strong></h2>

                <p>Openness to Improve. I 100% agree. I strongly believe that continued learning is a key to being happy, and mentally fit, especially as we age. During my professional career, I have always sought opportunities for education, and training. I was fortunate in that my employer funded my degree in Aviation Management, and now after 30 years in Aviation, I am now studying IT for a career change, and looking forward to leaning a lot of new skills.</p>

            <h2><strong>My Interpretation and Team Composition</strong></h2>
                <p>All three test results, to me, are surprisingly accurate, and reflect my choice of career and hobbies to this point in my life. Professionally, working in aviation means you must be methodical and accurate, there is no room for cutting corners or rushed decisions. All work is carried within a strict regulatory framework and regulations, and must be done as accurately, and to the highest levels of quality possible. I prefer to work alone, but also work well in teams when needed, as is sometimes the case on larger jobs. Personally, I like to sit back and let others lead, I have no desire to lead or take a lead role, as it doesn’t interest me much. But I will contribute when needed, and do what I need to do, to get the project completed. I prefer to help others over myself and will let others take work that I would have liked, as I feel taking it for myself will have a negative impact on others. This unfortunately means I will get stuck with work I’m not so enthusiastic in, or outside my skillset, though I will ask for guidance and help If required, as I will willing help others in the team where I can.</p>
